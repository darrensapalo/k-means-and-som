# K-means and SOM visualization

## Introduction
This Java project allows you to visualize a dataset using SOM and k-means.

## Where's the data?
You can find the data (csv files) inside the `warehouse/` folder. You can create a folder there for your other __database or csv__. The name of the folder will represent the name of your database.

## How do I use it?
Currently, you go to the Driver class in the default package and select which __database or csv__ to use. Afterwards, run the program and wait for the .html file to output inside the __database or csv__ specific folder.

## Where do I put the k-means code?
It's meant to be placed inside the Kmeans class, but it currently does not have code yet. It's meant to import classes from the Weka library, but I'm still not sure what Weka provides.
